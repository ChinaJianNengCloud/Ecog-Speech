%% EXAMPLE OF CONTAMINATION ANALYSIS

% This script analyzes the spectrogram correlations between and audio file
% and a brain recording files. Both files should be MAT-files with a
% defined structure called RecordingMatfiles (see files in 'Test data'
% folder). 'Data_preparation_example' script shows how to create these
% files.
